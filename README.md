# VOCA

## Simple standalone or offline vocabulary.

### Features planned:
### * Translations from one language to another
### * Add support for different vocabularies
### * Repetitor of new words

#### Some notes:

Currently there is a dictionary parser implemented with python code. The parser extracts lexems from the dictionary and put them into a SQLite DB.
Antoher piece of the project it is an Android application which is working using the DB.

Now I have a parset for Russian - English vocabulary (kre-ru-en.txt) in cp-1251 encoding.
